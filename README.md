# 📊 SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Advanced Business Analytics

This repository showcases a **comprehensive SQL portfolio project** inspired by **Data with Baraa**, focusing on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Advanced Business Analytics** using SQL.  
The project demonstrates how to systematically explore datasets, uncover hidden insights, and generate **stakeholder-ready business reports** using **SQL only**.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The project is divided into two major parts:  

### 1. **SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
A structured, six-step framework for exploring and understanding datasets:  

1. **Database Exploration** – Inspecting database structure & metadata  
2. **Dimensions Exploration** – Exploring categorical fields (products, customers, regions)  
3. **Date Exploration** – Analyzing temporal coverage & seasonality  
4. **Measures Exploration** – Summarizing quantitative metrics (sales, quantity, costs)  
5. **Magnitude Analysis** – Aggregating KPIs across dimensions (e.g., revenue by category)  
6. **Ranking Analysis** – Identifying top/bottom performers (e.g., best-selling products)  

---

### 2. **SQL Advanced Business Analytics**
A real-world portfolio project applying advanced SQL techniques for business problem-solving:  

1. **Changes Over Time Analysis** – Trend, seasonality & growth insights  
2. **Cumulative Analysis** – Running totals & moving averages  
3. **Performance Analysis** – Current vs. previous period comparisons  
4. **Part-to-Whole Analysis** – Market share & contribution analysis  
5. **Data Segmentation** – Customer & product segmentation (e.g., RFM analysis)  
6. **Customer Report Generation** – Actionable customer intelligence  
7. **Product Report Generation** – Product lifecycle & profitability insights

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated

### ✅ Basic SQL
- Aggregations (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`)  
- `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`  
- `JOIN` operations (fact & dimension tables)  
- Filtering with `WHERE`  

### ✅ Advanced SQL
- **Window functions:** `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`  
- Aggregate window functions: `SUM() OVER`, `AVG() OVER`  
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**  
- Subqueries & nested queries  
- Date manipulation functions (`YEAR()`, `MONTH()`, `DATE_TRUNC()`)  
- Conditional logic (`CASE WHEN`)

## 📂 Dataset Structure
The project is built on a **retail/e-commerce dataset** with three core tables:  

- **Customers** → Demographics & geographic info  
- **Products** → Product catalog with categories & pricing  
- **Sales** → Transaction-level data (dates, quantities, revenue)  

---

## 💡 Business Value
- **Strategic Decision Making** – Long-term trend analysis for business planning  
- **Performance Monitoring** – KPI tracking & improvement insights  
- **Customer Intelligence** – Behavior understanding & segmentation  
- **Product Analytics** – Portfolio optimization & pricing strategies  
- **Operational Insights** – Seasonal demand patterns & resource allocation
